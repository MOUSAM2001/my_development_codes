# üöÄ CLI Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

## üìÅ Navigation & File Operations
```bash
# Navigation
pwd                     # Print working directory
ls -la                  # List all files with details
cd /path/to/dir         # Change directory
cd ~                    # Go home
cd -                    # Go to previous directory

# File Operations
touch file.txt          # Create empty file
mkdir -p path/to/dir    # Create directory tree
cp -r source dest       # Copy recursively
mv old new              # Move/rename
rm -rf directory        # Remove directory (CAREFUL!)
ln -s target link       # Create symbolic link

# File Viewing
cat file.txt            # Show entire file
less file.txt           # Page through file
head -n 20 file.txt     # First 20 lines
tail -f log.txt         # Follow file (great for logs)
```

## üîç Search & Text Processing
```bash
# Finding Files
find . -name "*.py"     # Find Python files
find . -type f -size +1M # Files larger than 1MB
locate filename         # Fast search (uses database)
which command           # Find command location

# Text Search
grep -r "pattern" .     # Search recursively
grep -i "text" file     # Case insensitive
grep -v "exclude" file  # Invert match
grep -n "text" file     # Show line numbers

# Text Processing
sed 's/old/new/g' file  # Replace all occurrences
awk '{print $1}' file   # Print first column

Ctrl+Z                 # Suspend current command
Ctrl+R                 # Search command history

# Navigation
Tab                    # Auto-complete
‚Üë/‚Üì                   # Command history
Ctrl+R                 # Reverse search history
!!                     # Repeat last command
!string                # Repeat last command starting with string
```

## üéØ Common Patterns
```bash
# Count files by extension
find . -name "*.py" | wc -l

# Find largest files
find . -type f -exec ls -la {} \; | sort -k5 -nr | head -10

# Backup with timestamp
cp important.txt "important_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt"

# Remove files older than 30 days
find /tmp -type f -mtime +30 -delete

# Check disk usage by directory
du -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr

# Monitor log files in real-time
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep ERROR

# Count unique IPs in access log
awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Convert spaces to underscores in filenames
for file in *; do mv "$file" "${file// /_}"; done
```

## üîß Environment Variables
```bash
# View and Set
echo $PATH             # Show PATH variable
export VAR=value       # Set variable
env                    # Show all variables
which $SHELL           # Show current shell

# Common Variables
$HOME                  # Home directory
$USER                  # Current username
$PWD                   # Current directory
$PATH                  # Executable search path
```

## üéÆ Pro Tips
- Use `man command` for detailed help
- `command --help` for quick help
- Tab completion saves time and prevents typos
- `history` shows command history
- Use `screen` or `tmux` for persistent sessions
- `alias ll='ls -la'` for custom shortcuts
- `Ctrl+C` stops most anything
- `which command` shows command location
- `type command` shows command type

## üö® Safety Tips
- Always double-check `rm -rf` commands
- Use `cp -i` and `mv -i` for interactive mode
- Test commands on copies first
- Use `ls` before `rm` to see what you're deleting
- Keep backups of important files
- Use quotes around filenames with spaces
- Be careful with sudo/root permissions

Remember: Practice makes perfect! üöÄ
